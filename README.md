## Issues While Completing Assignment
The hardest part of this assignment was the grid from Bootstrap. I had the most difficult time figuring out how to use it, and probably wouldn't have been able to if it wasn't for the outside resource I utilized. The rest of the assignment was very easy, and I quite enjoyed not having to code it, but I do not understand the grid from Bootstrap and was very confused since I didn't write the code myself.

## Outside Resources
I was only able to figure out the grid system from Bootstrap after looking at the examples from W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_grid_examples.asp. The specific code that helped me can be found here: https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_grid_examples11&stacked=h I was able to copy what they had and fiddle with the column numbers in order to have the look I was going for (1 column for mobile, 2 for tablet and 3 for desktop).
